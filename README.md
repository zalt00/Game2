# Game

Setup:
 1. launch `shell.cmd`
 2. enter the command `venv`, make sure python 3.6+ is installed and in your PATH environment variable
 
Launchers:
 - `launcher.cmd`: classic launcher, cmd not hidden
 - `launcherwoc.cmd`: launcher without console, hides cmd
 - `launcherdb.cmd`: debug launcher, simply keeps the console alive after the program finished so you can see the error
 if the program crashes, later it will launch the program in debug mode, which is not implemented yet
 - `structure_builder_launcher.cmd`: launcher for the structure builder
